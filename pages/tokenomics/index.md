# FAITH Token Tokenomics Overview

## Overview
The FAITH Token serves as the cornerstone of the economic system within "Lords Forsaken," a global multi-blockchain game. Designed with a fixed supply of 100 million tokens, the FAITH Token is pivotal in facilitating not only gameplay elements but also the broader economic interactions across various platforms. This non-inflationary model ensures that no additional tokens will be minted after the initial deployment, preserving the token's value against dilution.

The token’s utility spans several functions—from in-game purchases and rewards to acting as a currency within the game’s marketplace. It is also used to incentivize player engagement and fund operational activities. The FAITH Token is integral to maintaining a vibrant ecosystem, providing players and stakeholders with a stable and predictable model that supports the game's long-term growth and sustainability.

By integrating this token deeply into the gameplay and broader transactional elements, Lords Forsaken ensures that players are part of a dynamic economy, where their actions and achievements can have a real-world impact. This approach not only enhances engagement but also enriches the player's gaming experience by linking their success in the game with tangible rewards.
