## Token Utility
The FAITH Token is designed to be deeply integrated into the gameplay and economy of "Lords Forsaken," providing multiple utilities that enhance the player experience and drive the game's economy. Below are the key functionalities and uses of the FAITH Token within the game environment:

### In-Game Purchases
- **Customization Items:** Players can use FAITH Tokens to acquire a variety of customization options for their characters and environments. This includes skins, boards, avatars, and special foils, all of which enhance the visual appeal and personalization of the gameplay experience.
- **Elixirs:** Special items like the "Elixir of Fate" can be purchased with FAITH Tokens. These elixirs provide players with gameplay advantages, such as improved chances of obtaining rare items during pack openings.

### Marketplace Transactions
- **Primary Currency:** FAITH Tokens are the primary currency within the game’s NFT marketplace, required for all transactions. This includes buying, selling, or trading in-game assets, ensuring that the token circulates within the ecosystem, thus supporting the game's economy.
- **Fee Burn:** To help control inflation and add a deflationary aspect to the token’s economy, a percentage of the tokens used in marketplace transactions are burned. Specifically, 1% of the transaction amount in FAITH Tokens is permanently removed from circulation with each transaction.

### Play-to-Earn Rewards
- **Player Rewards:** FAITH Tokens are awarded to players as part of the Play-to-Earn model. Players earn tokens by achieving certain milestones or winning battles, which can then be used within the game or traded on external platforms.

### Staking and Governance
- **Future Utilities:** Plans are in place to expand the utility of FAITH Tokens to include staking mechanisms and governance features. Players will potentially be able to stake their tokens to receive rewards and participate in decision-making processes regarding future game developments and updates.

This multifaceted utility design not only ensures that players have compelling reasons to acquire and use FAITH Tokens but also stabilizes the token’s value by tying it closely to the core activities and success of "Lords Forsaken."
