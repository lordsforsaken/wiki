## Play-to-Earn (P2E) Mechanics
The Play-to-Earn model is central to "Lords Forsaken," offering players the opportunity to earn FAITH Tokens through their in-game activities and achievements. This model is designed to reward players not only for their skill and dedication but also for their engagement with the game community. Hereâ€™s how the P2E mechanics work:

### Earning Through Gameplay
- **Milestones and Achievements:** Players earn FAITH Tokens by reaching specific milestones, completing challenges, or achieving high ranks in competitions. These activities are designed to suit a variety of player levels and preferences, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to earn.
- **Tournaments and Events:** Regularly scheduled tournaments and special events offer additional opportunities for players to earn tokens. These are often tiered to cater to different skill levels, providing fair chances for all participants to win rewards.

### Dynamic Reward System
- **Scaling with Engagement:** The amount of FAITH Tokens a player can earn is dynamically adjusted based on the total player base and game economy conditions. This system ensures that the rewards are sustainable and that the value of FAITH Tokens remains stable as the game grows.
- **Weekly Emissions:** Tokens are distributed on a weekly basis, with the amount available each week decreasing by 1.5%. This diminishes over time, encouraging early participation and continuous engagement.

### Special In-Game Items
- **Elixirs and Power-Ups:** Players can purchase or earn special items like the Elixir of Fate, which can enhance their chances of acquiring rare and valuable in-game assets. These items can sometimes be obtained through gameplay or purchased with FAITH Tokens.

### Token Utility Expansion
- **Staking Opportunities:** Future updates include plans for staking mechanisms where players can stake their FAITH Tokens to earn rewards. This could include earning passive income from staking or gaining access to special in-game content and events.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Features:** Integrating DeFi features into the game to allow players to lend, borrow, or earn interest on their FAITH Tokens, further integrating the token into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

### Sustainable Economy Design
- **Vesting Contracts for P2E Rewards:** To promote a gradual and sustained token release into the economy, P2E rewards are distributed through vesting contracts. This ensures a controlled flow of tokens, preventing inflation and encouraging long-term engagement.

This comprehensive P2E framework ensures that "Lords Forsaken" is not just a game, but a thriving ecosystem where players can genuinely profit from their gaming skills and strategic thinking. By aligning player rewards with game progress and community involvement, we foster a deeply engaging and economically viable gaming experience.
