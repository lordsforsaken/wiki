## Play-to-Earn Emission Schedule
The FAITH Token is minted in a one-time event at deployment, creating a fixed total of 100 million tokens. This finite supply ensures that the token's value is protected against inflation. To manage the distribution of these tokens effectively within the "Lords Forsaken" ecosystem, a distinct emission schedule is applied specifically for the Play-to-Earn (P2E) rewards.

### Weekly Reduction Rate
The P2E token distribution incorporates a weekly reduction rate of 2%. This methodical decrement is designed to mimic deflationary cryptocurrency strategies, ensuring a predictable decrease in new token availability over time. This helps in stabilizing the token's value as the game progresses.

### Distribution Dynamics
Of the total token supply, 30% is allocated towards P2E rewards. These tokens are scheduled for distribution over a four-year period, decreasing by 1.5% each week. This structure not only incentivizes early and continued player engagement by making the tokens a valuable and diminishing reward but also ensures longevity in player retention.

By controlling the rate of token flow into the economy, the emission schedule aims to balance the early adoption incentives with the necessity of preserving token value over the long term. This approach maintains a healthy economic environment that supports both the influx of new players and the sustained engagement of the community.
