## Distribution Details
The FAITH Token is strategically allocated to ensure sustainable growth of the "Lords Forsaken" ecosystem, supporting both the game's operational framework and its community. The token distribution is carefully planned to align with the long-term objectives of the game and its stakeholders:

- **Founders (20%):** A total of 20% of the FAITH tokens are allocated to the founders. This allocation is vested over a period of one year to align founder incentives with the long-term success and health of the game. The gradual release of tokens ensures that the founders remain committed to improving and expanding the game over time.

- **Player Payouts (P2E) (30%):** Thirty percent of the tokens are dedicated to player payouts, forming the core of the Play-to-Earn model. These tokens are distributed over four years following a diminishing rate of -1.5% per week, which guarantees that early adopters and active players are rewarded, while also maintaining a reserve for future players. This payout system is designed to be fair, rewarding players for their engagement and achievements within the game.

- **Project Treasury (50%):** The largest portion of the token supply, 50%, is reserved for the project treasury. These funds are utilized to cover various operational costs including but not limited to linex bribes, organizing tournaments, community initiatives, and auditing services. This allocation ensures the game has sufficient capital to support ongoing development, marketing efforts, and community-driven activities, which are essential for the gameâ€™s growth and sustainability.
