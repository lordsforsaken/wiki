## Liquidity and Financial Infrastructure - Roadmap
As part of our commitment to ensure the robustness and sustainability of the "Lords Forsaken" economy, we are actively developing and enhancing the liquidity and financial infrastructure. Below are our ongoing and future initiatives:

### Current Achievements
- **Initial Liquidity Pool on Lynex:** We have successfully established a small liquidity pool for the FAITH/ETH pair on Lynex, the largest DeFi platform on the Linea blockchain. This initial step into decentralized finance provides our players and investors with immediate trading opportunities. The pool can be accessed through the contract address: `0x373d04a7f3594ff9011af5084587182c0056721e`. This early implementation supports smoother transactions and enhances price stability for FAITH Tokens.

### Q2 2024 Goals
- **Expansion of Liquidity Pools:** By June 2024, we plan to expand our liquidity provisions by adding more pools on other prominent decentralized exchanges (DEXes). These additional pools will facilitate broader access and improved liquidity for the FAITH Token, enhancing its utility and stability.
- **Financial Partnerships:** We aim to forge partnerships with key financial platforms to further integrate FAITH Tokens into wider financial ecosystems. This will make it easier for players to buy, sell, and trade FAITH Tokens both within and outside of the game.

### Long-Term Vision
- **Treasury Management Enhancements:** Our treasury management strategy includes strengthening financial reserves through strategic investments in other blockchain assets and financial instruments. This approach aims to diversify risks and generate additional revenue to support game development and operations.
- **Introduction of Financial Instruments:** We are exploring options to introduce derivative financial instruments, such as token-based bonds or futures. These tools will provide our community with more sophisticated financial options.
- **Advanced Liquidity Solutions:** Future developments include creating proprietary liquidity solutions tailored to our gameâ€™s ecosystem, potentially featuring automated market makers (AMM) to ensure sustained liquidity under various market conditions.

These planned and ongoing initiatives are crafted to establish a stable and resilient financial foundation for "Lords Forsaken," enabling the game to thrive and adapt to both community needs and broader market dynamics.
