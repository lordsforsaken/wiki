## Marketplace Dynamics - Roadmap
As part of our ongoing development and enhancement of the "Lords Forsaken" ecosystem, the marketplace dynamics are scheduled for significant updates and integrations by June 2024. Here are the planned advancements:

### Immediate Enhancements
- **Transaction Mechanics and Token Utilization:** We will continue to refine the use of FAITH Tokens within all marketplace transactions, ensuring it remains the central medium for trade and economic activity within the game.
- **Royalty and Fee Structure:** We aim to optimize the distribution of transaction fees to support continuous development, reward creators, and maintain a deflationary pressure on the token supply through strategic burns.

### Q2 2024 Enhancements
- **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Integration:** By June 2024, we plan to integrate a fully operational decentralized exchange within "Lords Forsaken." This will facilitate direct FAITH Token trading against other cryptocurrencies, providing players with increased liquidity and simpler access to the broader crypto market.
- **Smart Contract Automation:** The incorporation of smart contracts into the marketplace is targeted for completion by mid-2024. These contracts will automate security and transaction complexity, ensuring that agreements are executed flawlessly and without the need for intermediaries.

### Long-Term Vision
- **Global Trading Hub:** Looking beyond 2024, the "Lords Forsaken" marketplace aims to evolve into a global trading hub for digital assets, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparent and secure transactions. This will enhance the gameâ€™s position in the digital economy, potentially attracting a broader audience and fostering a more vibrant community.

These steps are designed to ensure that "Lords Forsaken" not only keeps pace with technological advancements but also continues to offer an engaging and economically viable environment for its players.
