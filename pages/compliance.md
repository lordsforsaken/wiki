## Security and Compliance
Ensuring the security and compliance of our financial operations and token handling is paramount for "Lords Forsaken." We are committed to implementing robust security measures and complying with all relevant regulations to maintain the integrity of our gaming ecosystem. Here are the key components of our security and compliance strategy:

### Use of Gnosis Safe
- **Secure Wallet Management:** We use Gnosis Safe for managing the treasury funds and other critical financial operations. Gnosis Safe is renowned for its multi-signature security mechanism, which requires multiple confirmations before transactions can be executed, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access or fund mismanagement.

### Vesting Contracts
- **Sustainable Token Release:** To ensure a stable and sustainable growth of our game economy, we utilize vesting contracts for distributing tokens to founders and as part of our Play-to-Earn (P2E) model. These contracts are designed to release FAITH Tokens gradually over time, according to pre-set schedules. This approach prevents market flooding and supports the long-term commitment of token holders.
  - **Foundersâ€™ Funds:** Founders' tokens are vested over a one-year period to align their interests with the long-term success of the game.
  - **P2E Rewards:** Tokens allocated for P2E incentives are released over a four-year period, ensuring that players are rewarded consistently while maintaining token scarcity.

### Verified Smart Contracts
- **ERC-20 Contract Verification:** The ERC-20 contract for the FAITH token deployed on the Linea network is fully verified. This ensures transparency and builds trust with the community, as anyone can review the contract details on the main Linea network explorer.

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Adherence to Regulations:** We are dedicated to complying with all applicable financial and gaming regulations in the jurisdictions we operate. This compliance is critical to ensure that we provide a legally secure platform for our players and stakeholders.
- **Regular Audits:** To further bolster our commitment to security and compliance, we conduct regular audits of our smart contracts and security protocols. These audits are performed by independent third-party security firms to ensure transparency and trustworthiness.

### Future Security Enhancements
- **Continuous Improvement:** As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we continuously monitor and update our security practices and infrastructure to address new challenges and adhere to best practices in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.

These security measures and compliance practices are foundational to our operations, providing a secure, reliable, and lawful environment for all players and stakeholders involved in "Lords Forsaken."
