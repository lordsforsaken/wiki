# Card Leveling and Upgrade Mechanics

## Overview

In *Lords Forsaken*, cards can be upgraded or leveled up to enhance their power and abilities in battles. Each card, depending on its foil type—either Silver or Gold—has different requirements for leveling. Silver cards are standard, while Gold cards represent a premium foil type and often start at higher levels, skipping the initial stages of progression.

## How Leveling Affects Card Stats and Abilities

When a card is leveled up in *Lords Forsaken*, it typically gains improvements in various stats such as attack, health, and speed, making the card more powerful and effective in battle. Alongside these stat increases, some levels might also introduce or enhance abilities, adding strategic depth and unique capabilities to the card.

It is important to note that not all stat increases are purely beneficial. For instance, the mana cost of a card—representing the cost to play the card in a game—may also increase with certain levels. This is a balancing measure to ensure that more powerful cards require careful consideration and strategic planning to use effectively.

## Leveling Requirements

The requirements to level up cards differ based on the card's rarity and foil type. Below is a comprehensive table that outlines the number of same-type Silver or Gold foil cards needed to reach each level:
