## Impact on the Marketplace

**P2P Marketplace Dynamics**

In the P2P marketplace, the law of supply and demand reigns supreme. Items of higher rarity command greater prices due to their scarcity and the prestige they confer upon their owners. 

**Rental Market Considerations**

The rental market thrives on the temporary exchange of high-rarity items. Owners of rare, epic, and legendary items can capitalize on their exclusivity, offering them for rent to other players seeking temporary enhancements for their gameplay.

**Economic Ecosystem**

A robust economic ecosystem is fostered by the rarity system, encouraging players to engage not just in gameplay but also in strategic economic decisions. Possessing a rare item could be the stepping stone to a player's financial success within the game.
