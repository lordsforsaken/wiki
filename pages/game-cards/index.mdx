# Card Stats

## The Basics

Each card is distinguished by its unique combination of stats, dictating its performance during battle.

## Levels and Stats Variation

Can a card exhibit different stats? Yes, depending on its level, which can range from 1 to 10. As the level increases, so do the stats, enhancing the card's effectiveness in battle.

## Detailed Stats List

- **Speed**

  Speed affects the chance of hitting or missing the opponent. Special abilities, such as flying, grant additional dodge chances (flying adds 25%). The base dodge chance is 10%, with every point of speed difference adjusting the dodge chance by an additional 10%. This mechanic introduces strategic depth, encouraging calculated risks.

- **Melee**

  Melee attacks are usually frontal, but certain abilities allow attacks from different positions, enhancing tactical flexibility.

- **Ranged**

  Ranged units can attack from behind the frontline, accumulating damage over time while remaining protected. This offers a strategic advantage for sustained offense.

- **Magic**

  Similar to ranged attacks, magic attacks bypass armor and directly target the enemy's health, offering a significant strategic edge.

- **Armor**

- **Health**
