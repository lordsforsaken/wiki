# NFT Card Game: Foil System Overview

## Introduction

Our NFT card game offers players the opportunity to enhance their gameplay and rewards through the acquisition and use of special foil cards. There are two types of foil cards: **Silver** and **Gold**. This document provides detailed information on each foil type, their benefits, and how they influence rewards in competitive leagues.

## Card Types

### Free-to-Use Cards

- **Description**: These standard cards are available to all players without the need to purchase or unlock through achievements. They form the foundation of gameplay and the reward structure. Importantly, free-to-use cards are never owned by the player and cannot be leveled up. Leveling up in our game is achieved by merging cards, a feature not available for free-to-use cards.
- **Rewards**: Provides standard bonus per battle, measured in cryptocurrency, serving as the baseline for reward calculations.

### Silver Cards

- **Description**: A step above the free-to-use cards, Silver foil cards offer enhanced visuals and increased reward potential.
- **Rewards**: Players using Silver cards receive a higher reward per battle than those using free-to-use cards. Silver cards enhance the standard bonus by a specific percentage, offering more lucrative cryptocurrency rewards.

### Gold Cards

- **Description**: The most prestigious of card types, Gold foil cards are not only visually superior but also the rarest. They offer the highest rewards and collectibility.
- **Rarity**: The chance of acquiring a Gold card upon opening a new pack is 2%. This rarity factor makes Gold cards a coveted item within the game.
- **Rewards**: Utilizing Gold cards significantly increases cryptocurrency bonuses per battle, far exceeding the bonuses from Silver or free-to-use cards.

## Competitive Leagues

Competitive leagues highlight the value of owning Silver and Gold foil cards. Rewards in these leagues are based on performance and the type of cards used:

- **Free-to-Use Cards**: Offer the baseline reward structure. These cards, while fundamental to gameplay, do not offer the potential for reward increases through leveling.
- **Silver Cards**: Provide an increase in crypto rewards per battle, encouraging players to engage in competitive play and to develop more complex strategies.
- **Gold Cards**: Yield the highest reward increase per battle. The rarity and premium status of Gold cards incentivize players to seek them out for competitive advantage and higher earnings.

## Conclusion

The foil system in our NFT card game rewards players for their investment, strategic play, and participation in competitive leagues. By incorporating Silver and Gold cards into their decks, players can significantly enhance their reward potential. With the addition of these foil cards, coupled with the strategic element of card leveling (excluding free-to-use cards), our game offers a rich, engaging experience for all. We encourage players to explore the various card types and to immerse themselves in the competitive spirit of the leagues.
