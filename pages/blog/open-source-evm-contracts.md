### Smart Contracts: Open Source & Bounty Program

At **Lords Forsaken**, we pride ourselves on transparency and the quality of our development. As part of our commitment to the community, we have made all our smart contracts open source. You can review, scrutinize, and contribute to our code directly on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lordsforsaken/evm-contracts).

While we have not commissioned any external audits, we have confidence in our code quality and security practices. To further ensure the integrity of our contracts, we are offering a **$100 bounty in $FAITH** to anyone who identifies a security vulnerability or other significant issue in our contracts. 

If you find a problem, please report it to us via our official channels, and we will promptly address the issue and reward you for your efforts.
