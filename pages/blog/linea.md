# Upcoming launch of card NFTs on Linea Mainnet

Hello crypto enthusiasts!

We are thrilled to announce that Lords Forsaken will be launching on the [Linea Network](https://linea.build/) on <u>**August 7th**</u>!

For those new to Lords Forsaken, it is an engaging and casual card strategy game designed for everyone to enjoy with minimal time commitment. The game is quick, easy to learn, but challenging to master. Each match typically lasts just 2-3 minutes, making it perfect for both casual and competitive players alike. The game is beautiful themed in ancient mythologies. 

We believe the game industry is saturated with fantasy worlds, which causes player acquisition friction. Instead, Lords Forsaken is beautifully themed around ancient mythologies, offering a refreshing and captivating experience.

## Cardpack ERC-20

A fungible ERC-20 token will be introduced that functions as a cardpack container. This token will run natively on the Linea Network and will be available for purchase on the [Lynex](https://www.lynex.fi/) platform. Liquidity for this token will be provided on the Lynex decentralized exchange as **$FAITH/$ALPHA** (Lords Forsaken CardPack Alpha Edition).

Whenever someone buys a cardpack with ETH, the DEX router will convert **$ETH** to [**$FAITH**](https://dexscreener.com/linea/0x7fee4f637bc38e73ebf4caed22a1941236b79bf4), positively impacting the game's native currency.

When a cardpack is opened (and burned), the user receives five random NFTs. This process is irreversible. Cardpacks will never expire and can be kept unopened for an unlimited amount of time.

### Provably Fair

The card pack opening algorithm is [provably fair](https://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org/wiki/Provably_fair_algorithm). It leverages a server-side pre-generated chain of hashes and a client seed. This transparent method ensures that the randomness of the card generation event is trustless and fair.

## NFT Contract ERC-721

The game cards in Lords Forsaken are actual NFTs, each with unique properties. [The Alpha edition](/card-editions/edition-alpha) features 48 different cards with varying rarities, and each card is available in two different [foils](game-cards/card-foils): regular and gold. Gold foils are more rare (2% chance) and provide an extra multiplier for crypto gains in battle.

There are 4 different [rarities](/game-cards/card-rarities): common, rare, epic, and legendary. The probabilities for each rarity are hard-coded in the contract. 

NFT cards can be leveled up by [merging](/game-cards/card-leveling) cards of the same type and foil. Fusion results in a stronger card, although this process is irreversible. Some cards gain improved [stats](/game-cards), while leveling can also provide new abilities.

Game card NFTs are transferable and compatible with most NFT marketplaces.


## Play To Earn

At Lords Forsaken, we embrace the concept of play-to-earn because we believe competitive gaming deserves more than just rankings and fame. The intensity and dedication required in this space should be met with tangible rewards, making the effort truly worthwhile. 

**$FAITH** tokens will be distributed for every won battle and at the end of each season based on final rankings.

More info on play2earn mechanics [here](http://localhost:5173/tokenomics/p2e).

### Lynex DEX and DeFi Infrastructure

The Lynex platform will serve as the main infrastructure for the game economy. Both **$FAITH** and **$$ALPHA** cardpacks will be purchasable through the Lynex swap. 

Players and investors can also farm **$LYNX** tokens by providing liquidity on Lynex. Natively, Lynex offers various incentives to attract more liquidity, but we are also giving exclusive unique promo cards for a limited time to early liquidity providers. (Contact us for more info.)

## Element NFT Marketplace Integration

[Element](https://element.market/linea) is a well-established marketplace across many blockchains, including Linea. Lords Forsaken NFTs have already been tested on the Element marketplace (testnet version), ensuring that NFTs will be ready for trading from the start.

We believe it is important to support the freedom for players to freely buy and sell their cards in a peer-to-peer manner. Often, players need just one or two cards to complete their desired deck, so this marketplace is a great option for advancing in the game. There will be a 5% royalty on every transaction.


## GamePlay Changes and Patches

Our team includes dedicated, experienced gamers in game designer roles who actively engage with players to gather feedback and ensure the right balance for the cards and game mechanics.

We are planning a new set of patches to make the game even more balanced and enjoyable by slightly adjusting the stats and [abilities](/game-cards/cards-abilities) of some cards. This means some cards will be strengthened, while others will have their power reduced.

This balancing process is a natural part of every new game, and you can expect fewer changes as we approach the final stages of game design.

### Game Stability

In the early stages, we focused on achieving a minimal level of optimization to get an alpha version playable as quickly as possible. This was necessary due to the extensive list of features, mechanics, and UI menus that needed to be built before reaching the minimal viable product. 

Now that most of the game features are in place, we have successfully undergone a major game optimization overhaul. We are thrilled with the significant improvements in stability and performance, resulting in greater frames per second.

## Marketing

Our team's marketing efforts are rapidly translating into increased visits. Recently, many major crypto game repositories, such as [playtoearn](https://playtoearn.com/blockchaingame/lords-forsaken) and [dappradar](https://dappradar.com/dapp/lords-forsaken), have listed us.

A Facebook ads campaign is also starting next week. We will be targeting the Philippines, and new players who achieve a certain number of victories through this campaign will receive exclusive unique promo cards.

We continue to reach out to as many game repositories as possible while maintaining a transparent and regular presence on [Twitter](https://x.com/lordsforsak3n).

### Referral System

Parallel to the launch in Linea we will be releasing a new referral system to help the game rapidly expand and reach its audience. The referral system has two steps, with each step paying 10% of the purchased cardpacks (at the time they are opened) to the referrer.

Please note that your referral fee is paid only when the cardpacks are opened, not at the time of purchase.

We are incredibly excited about the results of our many months of hard work. We truly hope the community shares our enthusiasm. The adventure of Lords Forsaken has just begun. More card editions and updates are on the way, and we will continue to evolve to bring you a top-tier casual gaming experience.
