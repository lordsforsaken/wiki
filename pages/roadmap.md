# Roadmap

## Liquidity and Financial Infrastructure - Roadmap
As part of our commitment to ensure the robustness and sustainability of the Lords Forsaken economy, we are actively developing and enhancing the liquidity and financial infrastructure. Below are our ongoing and future initiatives:

### Current Achievements
- **Initial Liquidity Pool on Lynex:** We have successfully established a small liquidity pool for the FAITH/ETH pair on Lynex, the largest DeFi platform on the Linea blockchain. This initial step into decentralized finance provides our players and investors with immediate trading opportunities. The pool can be accessed through the contract address: `0x373d04a7f3594ff9011af5084587182c0056721e`. This early implementation supports smoother transactions and enhances price stability for FAITH Tokens.
- **Presale Success on Koinos Network:** In April 2024, we successfully conducted a presale on the Koinos network, raising $35,000. This achievement underscores the growing interest and support for "Lords Forsaken" within the blockchain community.

### Q2 2024 Goals
- **Expansion of Liquidity Pools:** By June 2024, we plan to expand our liquidity provisions by adding more pools on other prominent decentralized exchanges (DEXes). These additional pools will facilitate broader access and improved liquidity for the FAITH Token, enhancing its utility and stability.
- **Financial Partnerships:** We aim to forge partnerships with key financial platforms to further integrate FAITH Tokens into wider financial ecosystems. This will make it easier for players to buy, sell, and trade FAITH Tokens both within and outside of the game.
- **Network Bridge:** We plan to implement a bridge between the Linea network and the Koinos network. This bridge will enable seamless token transfers and interoperability between the two networks, enhancing the utility and accessibility of FAITH Tokens.

## Marketplace Dynamics - Roadmap
As part of our ongoing development and enhancement of the Lords Forsaken ecosystem, the marketplace dynamics are scheduled for significant updates and integrations by June 2024. Here are the planned advancements:

### Immediate Enhancements
- **Transaction Mechanics and Token Utilization:** We will continue to refine the use of FAITH Tokens within all marketplace transactions, ensuring it remains the central medium for trade and economic activity within the game.
- **Royalty and Fee Structure:** We aim to optimize the distribution of transaction fees to support continuous development, reward creators, and maintain a deflationary pressure on the token supply through strategic burns.

### Q2 2024 Enhancements
- **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Integration:** By June 2024, we plan to integrate a fully operational decentralized exchange within "Lords Forsaken." This will facilitate direct FAITH Token trading against other cryptocurrencies, providing players with increased liquidity and simpler access to the broader crypto market.
- **Smart Contract Automation:** The incorporation of smart contracts into the marketplace is targeted for completion by mid-2024. These contracts will automate security and transaction complexity, ensuring that agreements are executed flawlessly and without the need for intermediaries.
